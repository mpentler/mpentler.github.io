<h1>Welcome to the 2019 Wuzzle MiniCTF!</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Here are a few challenges to keep you going. I have no desire or time to do this as a proper CTF with a web interface and whatnot right now 
but I may do that later in the year.</p>
<p>I've done a few categories again and hopefully they aren't too difficult. I tried to cover a variety of difficulty levels and offer reasonable points 
for each one.</p>

<h2>The Challenges</h2>

<h3>Image Manipulation</h3>

<b>image-0 - 25 pts</b>
<p>There's something odd about this QR code...</p>
  <img src="image-0.png">

<b>image-1 - 50 pts</b>
<p>This QR code looks a bit mangled. What happened when it was being transmitted? Try and fix it.</p>
  <img src="image-1.png">

<b>image-2 - 50 pts</b>
<p>First challenge: What the hell is this? Second challenge: What's wrong with it?</p>
  <img src="image-2.png">

<h3>Forensics</h3>

<b>forensics-0 - 25 pts</b>
<p>This image was recovered from a recent data dump but it won't open. What's wrong?</p>

<h3>Reversing/Binary</h3>

<b>reverse-0 - 25/100 pts</b>
  <a href="reverse-0">Click to download - chmod +x before attempting!</a>
<p>If only this damn app didn't quit so quickly. Maybe we can stop it doing that? <b>Note: There are two point values available for this. You can 
either solve it the easy (cheating!) way or the hard way. Be honest, tell me what you did specifically. These are the resources I've got, I'm afraid.</b></p>

<h3>Cryptography</h3>

<b>crypto-0 - 25 pts</b>
  <pre>eae8e7e7f1f8e6e9f5f8c2ece8f4fef6f8eee9c2ffefe8e9f8fbf2effef8e0</pre>
<p>This flag has been ciphered with a single byte XOR key. Decrypt it.</p>

<b>crypto-1 - 50 pts</b>
  <pre>184efd1557e2144fef0e4fd81b54e80464eb0055e00a49fa</pre>
<p>This flag has been ciphered with a 4 byte XOR key. A little harder, but computers are powerful now...</p>
